 * Coverage fix from https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/pull/2275
 * In our tests this seems to only affect the coverage of TypeScript files,
 * hence including the fix in jest-runner should be sufficient.
 *
 * Original comment:
 * Work-around for #1887 and #2239 while waiting for https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/pull/706
 * Goes through all files in the coverage map and checks if branchMap's have
 * if-statements with implicit else. When finds one, copies source location of
 * the if-statement into the else statement.
